# Heidi labs Cetis data-wrangling support repository
Scripts, tools and code to support the heidilabs Jisc project.

## Repository Information

This repository contains links, scripts and information created by the Cetis data-wrangling team for Jisc Heidi Labs. 
Anybody working on the labs is welcome to contribute to the repository. The workflow for addign content is very simple:

- Add an issue to the issue tracker to alert everyone to what you are working on and why
- Make an edit or add a file in this repository, and save it to your own branch. If you prefer, you can fork the whole repository and work in your own repository
- Send a pull request once you're done

You can do all this through the Github GUI, but you're welcome to use any other git tool you prefer.

If the need arises, particular versions will get their own branches, but until that time, everything is merged into the main branch. Releases will be made after the group has come to an agreement.
